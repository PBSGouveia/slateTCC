      Various incarnations of a Doctor Strange film have been in development since 
      the mid-1980s until Paramount Pictures acquired the film rights in April 2005 
      on behalf of Marvel Studios. Thomas Dean Donnelly and Joshua Oppenheimer were 
      brought on board in June 2010 to write a screenplay. In June 2014, Derrickson 
      and Spaihts were hired to direct and re-write the film, respectively. 
      Cumberbatch was chosen for the eponymous role in December 2014, necessitating 
      a schedule change to work around his other commitments. This gave Derrickson 
      time to work on the script himself, for which he brought Cargill on to help. 
      The film began principal photography in November 2015 in Nepal before moving 
      to the United Kingdom, and concluded in New York City in April 2016. Filming 
      also occurred in Hong Kong.</p>     <!-- display the description -->
